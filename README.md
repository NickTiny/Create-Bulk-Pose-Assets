# **Usage**

Using **Create Bulk Pose Assets** is very similar to Vanilla Blender's **Create Pose Asset**. The difference is that **Create Bulk Pose Assets** will automatically create new Pose Assets using the "prefix" and current frame number. It uses the frames in the current action to generate the assets. 

1. Select an armature
2. Switch to Pose Mode
3. Open the Drop Sheet, Navitgate to the Pose Library Panel on the Right
4. Find the "**Create Bulk Assets** menu
5. Select the bone(s) in the 3D Viewport
6. Enter a prefix in the text field
7. Hit the **Create Bulk Pose Assets** to generate new assets
